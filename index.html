<h1>The Best Movies According to Nemanja</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>
  Rating: 10/10<br />
  Actors: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan<br />
  Review: This magnificent multigenerational mafia drama represents a benchmark
  not just in crime movies but in American cinema as a whole.
</p>
<h3>The Silence of the Lambs</h3>
<p>
  Rating: 9.2/10<br />
  Actors: Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn<br />
  Review: Young FBI Agent Clarice Starling is chasing a ruthless serial killer,
  she enlists the help of convict Doctor Hannibal Lecter, a notorious cannibal
  and master of manipulation.<br />
  If suspense thrillers are your thing, then this must rate as one of the
  greatest ever made. This film is genuinely unsettling throughout, you'll be
  wondering just who is playing who at times.<br />
  An absence of blood and gore, this relied on the story and acting, for my
  money it's infinitely superior to the films that followed. The psychological
  terror is the key to this films success.<br />
  Jodie Foster is excellent as Clarice, but Hopkins, what can you say, it's
  another of those performances that make you fully aware that he is one of the
  very best, he is outstanding in the role.<br />
  The dynamic and chemistry between Hopkins and Foster is off the scale, the
  tension, the unease, the uncomfortable forged bond.

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>
  Rating: 8.8/10<br />
  Actors: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise<br />
  Review: ... all that is, all that was and all that will ever be, through the
  life experiences of the titular character performed to perfection by Tom Hanks
  whose generous performance leaves us humbled and in awe of what we can
  achieve, how we can achieve it and why we would want that achievement in the
  first instance. A piece of cinematic storytelling that will perpetually
  resonate no matter who or what you are, where you are going or who you are
  going with - timeless.
